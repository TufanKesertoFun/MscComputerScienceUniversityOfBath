    "# Week 7 Activity – Logic & Prolog\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "Make sure you read the description of this activity on the course page before beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity is ungraded, and is unlike the others! This Jupyter notebook is mostly for consistency of presentation, you will not need to do any coding in Python, or any coding at all inside the notebook itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Details\n",
    "In part one you will be answering questions about logic and Prolog, which you can write directly into the notebook using Markdown and LaTeX. There will be example solutions available on the course page for those who have submitted their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part two is a challenge for those who want to explore beyond the scope of the unit and have a go at using Prolog to fit words into a predetermined crossword pattern. This notebook will explain the puzzle and give you a unique set up. You will then produce your Prolog code separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part two is a challenge that will require a significant amount of self-guided learning**. To be clear, the task is not very difficult for a Prolog programmer, but learning any new language is difficult, especially since it is likely an entirely new paradigm. Please consider this carefully! The tutors for the unit will try to support you as normal, but given this ungraded activity goes beyond the scope of the unit, there will be a limit to how much we can give.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do manage to complete part two, please share your results on the forum and discuss them with your peers."

    "### Step 1: Generate Your Crosswords\n",
